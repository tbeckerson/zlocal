cat << EOF
A fork/clone of the subversion xar repository from http://xar.googlecode.com/svn/ that
includes several enhancements and bug fixes including very basic command line signature
support (master branch). 

The XAR project aims to provide an easily extensible archive format. Important design
decisions include an easily extensible XML table of contents for random access to archived
files, storing the toc at the beginning of the archive to allow for efficient handling of
streamed archives, the ability to handle files of arbitrarily large sizes, the ability to
choose independent encodings for individual files in the archive, the ability to store
checksums for individual files in both compressed and uncompressed form, and the ability
to query the table of content's rich meta-data.
