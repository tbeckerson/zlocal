cat << EOF
Anything-sync-daemon (asd) is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed to manage user defined dirs in tmpfs and to periodically sync back to the physical disc (HDD/SSD). This is accomplished via a symlinking step and an innovative use of rsync to maintain back-up and synchronization between the two.
